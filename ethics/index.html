  <h2>Our ethics</h2>
<p>Since the opening of our first physical store on February 2, 2024, we have received over 700 complaints regarding the ethics of our business. Most of these complaints claim that we are murdering innocent Geometry Dash moderators. I am here to put these claims to rest.</p>

<p>Before we blend moderators up, we create a backup of their consciousness and a near-perfect recreation of their body, so the moderators can do everything they could before being blended after being blended; they can even eat themselves!</p>

<p>Do note that I have the ability to delete the consciousnesses of any moderator we blend up at any time, although why would I do that? All we want from moderators is their taste, not their life.</p>

<p>TLDR: The moderators you eat are ethically sourced.</p>
