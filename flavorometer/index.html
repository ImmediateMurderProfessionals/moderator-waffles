  <h2>How the Flavorometer works</h2>
<p>All moderators have flavors. More specifically, all moderators have the unique :3 flavor, along with up to 4 other flavors. These flavors are part of what makes Moderator Waffles unique.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Flavorometer, you can increase or decrease the prevalence of each of the flavors that the moderator has, free of charge. Just provide instructions on how strong or weak you want the flavors to be when you order your waffles.</p>
<p>If you do not provide any instructions, all flavors will be at their default 100% strength. Each flavor can be set between 0% and 200% strength, but we strongly advise against setting all the flavors to 0%.</p>
<p>As the current moderator in our waffles is Waffl3X, the current flavors are: :3, blackberry, waffle (yes, I am fully aware of this redundancy), and sweet tea.</p>
