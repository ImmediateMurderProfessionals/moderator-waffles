  <h2>Cookies???</h2>
<p>You might not know that the CEO of Moderator Waffles also runs a multidimensional cookie empire, which is largely unrelated to Moderator Waffles. Well, recently, one of the frequent customers of our cookie empire, who also is a fan of Moderator Waffles, suggested we combine the two together and make cookies made with Geometry Dash moderators! So that's exactly what we did.</p>

<p>Our cookies have many different types/flavors/whatever and are the same prices as waffles, except there's no fillings or toppings.</p>
