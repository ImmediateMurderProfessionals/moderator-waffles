  <h2>Cookie flavors</h2>
<p>Here are our cookie flavors:</p>
<li><b>Chocolate chip cookies-</b> Who doesn't love it?</li>
<li><b>Oatmeal raisin cookies-</b> Fake chocolate chip. Some people probably like them anyway.</li>
<li><b>Sugar cookies-</b> Sugar cookies with frosting. You can set the RGB value of your frosting.</li>
<li><b>Gingerbread men-</b> I don't really care that it's not Christmas, we're selling them anyway. Also these cookies have a soul. I think</li>
<li><b>M&M cookies-</b> Not to be confused with Moxxie and Millie from Helluva Boss.</li>
<li><b>Cinnamon cookies-</b> Cinnamon fox in cinnamon cookies? Hell yeah!</li>
<li><b>Fudge squares-</b> When something tastes as good as these, nobody cares that they're not cookies.</li>
<li><b>Double chip cookies-</b> It has been scientifically proven that cookies get better the more chocolate chips they have.</li>
<li><b>Big chip cookies-</b> It has also been scientifically proven that cookies get better the bigger their chocolate chips are.</li>
<li><b>Potato chip cookies-</b> Created when one of our employees didn't understand what chocolate chips are. These cookies' good taste is the only reason why he wasn't fired.</li>
<li><b>10 new flavors will be added every weekend! (if I remember)</b></li>
