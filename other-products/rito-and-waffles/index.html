  <h2>Rito and waffles</h2>
<p>Rito and waffles is just two regular moderator waffles, but you get some fried rito on top of each of them! (Rito meat is similar to chicken meat, but with a stronger taste)</p>

<p>Because of the rito meat, there are only two toppings you can get with rito and waffles: maple syrup and assorted berries, which are both free. Both will be available for regular waffles soon.</p>

<p>Rito and waffles costs $0.99, and you can get up to 4 fillings in each waffle; each additional filling is $0.03 per waffle.</p>
