  <h2>Waffle sundaes</h2>
<p>Waffle sundaes are two waffles, stacked on top of each other, with a big scoop of ice cream along with fresh blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries.</p>
<p>The two waffles can be any <a href=/moderator-waffles/buy-waffles/colors/>color</a> you want and have any <a href=/moderator-waffles/buy-waffles/fillings/>fillings</a> you want, but only one of the waffles can have <a href=/moderator-waffles/buy-waffles/toppings/>toppings</a>, which go on top of the ice cream and berries. In addition, the ice cream can be any flavor you want.</p>
<p>Waffle sundaes cost $1.49 and come with up to 3 fillings for each waffle and 2 additional toppings for the sundae. Each additional filling costs $0.03 per waffle and each additional topping costs $0.04.</p>
<p>Add link to ice cream flavors.</p>
<p>I'll add the google form to buy waffle sundaes later.</p>
