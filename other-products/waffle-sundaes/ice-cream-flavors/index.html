  <h2>Ice cream flavors</h2>
<p>Here are our ice cream flavors that you can get in your waffle sundaes:</p>
  <li><b>Vanilla-</b> Uses real vanilla, unlike the majority of vanilla ice cream</li>
  <li><b>Chocolate-</b> Just plain old delicious chocolate. Toxic to most dogs and cats.</li>
  <li><b>Strawberry-</b> Just like the stickberry, strawberries are not good for making houses. They both taste good however.</li>
  <li><b>Stickberry-</b> And they're both good in ice cream.</li>
  <li><b>Banana-</b> There's this crazy man named Gru that orders this multiple times a day! Why? What for?</li>
  <li><b>Coconut-</b> A giant fruit that makes you very fat if you eat too much</li>
  <li><b>Double chocolate chunk-</b> My favorite!</li>
  <li><b>Pistachio-</b> The fact that I cannot come up with a description pistachios me off.</li>
  <li><b>Enderman-</b> I got the idea for enderman flavored ice cream when I was in like 3rd grade and probably on crack.</li>
  <li><b>Pumpkin spice-</b> I think it's popular with teenagers in the fall, so it must be more popular when it isn't the fall!</li>
  <li><b>Orange-</b> A tasty yellow fruit, now in ice cream!</li>
  <li><b>Orange man-</b> It tastes like shit, but when something gets 77 million votes, taste isn't too important.</li>
  <li><b>Orange furry-</b> I wanted to make a joke about this delicious ice cream, but I split the responsibility of coding this website among 72 people and none of them have a sense of humor.</li>
  <li><b>Mint chocolate chip-</b> It's mint chocolate chip idk sketchup just fucking refuses to load and im pissed off actually never mind it works now.</li>
  <li><b>Butterscotch-</b> who up scotching they butter</li>
  <li><b>Cookies and cream-</b> Oreo-flavored ice cream with Oreo chunks. The word "cream" makes me want to make a cum joke for some reason.</li>
  <li><b>More coming March 1, 2025!</b></li>
