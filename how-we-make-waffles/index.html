  <h2>How we make waffles</h2>
<p>The way we make waffles is pretty simple. We start by procuring generic homemade waffle batter. That's the easy part.</p>
<p>The hard part is procuring the moderator to mix in with the batter. That's actually not too hard once you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>In order to get the moderator, you have to lure them to your kitchen. That's simple; we just request a special level to the moderator. Once the moderator plays the level, a special device utitlizes the moderator's device to send the moderator to my kitchen in no time!</p>
<p>Once the moderator is in our kitchen, we just throw them in a blender and blend for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Before you ask, "Isn't this like super illegal?", don't worry. The level that we request says in the description that if a moderator plays the level, they are hereby consenting to be baked into delicious waffles, and that description is legally binding.</p>
<p>Once the blending is done, we mix the generic waffle batter and moderator at about a 1:1 ratio of moderator to waffle batter as this produces the strongest flavor without the waffle falling apart.</p>
<p>We then mix that with whatever fillings the you order along with food dye of whatever color you order.</p>
<p>Then, we put the final waffle mix in a waffle iron for about two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>Once that time has elapsed, we just adjust the flavor to your liking, add whatever toppings you order, and then you can enjoy some Moderator Waffles!</p>
