  <h2>Toppings</h2>
<p>You can ask for many different toppings for the waffles you order.</p>
<p>Current list of toppings:</p>
  <li><b>Butter-</b> Made with milk from grass-fed, free-range cows.</li>
  <li><b>Maple syrup-</b> Just maple syrup. What else is there to say?</li>
  <li><b>Nutella-</b> A chocolate and hazelnut spread that originated in Italy in the 1960s. I love it.</li>
  <li><b>Whipped cream-</b> Please don't order this.</li>
  <li><b>Honey-</b> Sweet and sticky like maple syrup. You can thank bees for this topping.</li>
  <li><b>BBQ sauce-</b> First amendment, freedom of toppings.</li>
  <li><b>Chocolate frosting-</b> What if all our waffles are secretly just cake? What if we're all just cake? Who knows?</li>
  <li><b>Sir Pentious's bathwater-</b> Water that Sir Pentious bathed in. Tastes surprisingly good given what it is.</li>
  <li><b>Ink-</b> How else are we supposed to get rid of all the ink on the ground after turf wars? Don't worry, it's non-toxic.</li>
  <li><b>Cat-</b> I wasn't the one that put the cat in the blender, please, for the love of Slarg, don't arrest me!</li>
  <li><b>Rito egg-</b> A Rito egg. That's it. Just a Rito egg.</li>
  <li><b>Pink sauce-</b> Popular across several well-known CCP-owned social media sites. Probably doesn't cause botulism. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>Fuzzy ooze-</b> Imported fresh from Alterna. We don't know what happens if you eat it. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>Strange matter-</b> A hypothetical substance that could destroy the world. It's strangely tasty. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>Blood-</b> Real human blood. Has been cleaned so you do not get AIDS or other nasty diseases. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>Stupid sauce-</b> A popular sauce in strange 90s computer games. May cause hallucinaions. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>Oil-</b> A black liquid that makes cars go, among other things. Screws up the enviroment, unless it's in our delicious waffles. Can also be used as a filling.</li>
  <li><b>TF potion-</b> It turns you into... something. We did not make the potion, we just know what each potion is different, so you will not turn into the same thing each time.</li>
