  <h2>Fillings</h2>
<p>You can ask for many different fillings within the waffles you order.</p>
<p>Current list of fillings (unfinished):</p>
  <li><b>Chocolate chips-</b> Just your average delicious chocolate chips</li>
  <li><b>Blueberries-</b> All-natural blueberries with no pesticides or other yucky slop.</li>
  <li><b>Cinnamon-</b> Used in cuisine since ancient times. There's even a type of fox named after it.</li>
  <li><b>M&Ms-</b> The M&Ms you all know and love. Not to be confused with Moxxie and Millie.</li>
  <li><b>Octopus-</b> Octopus is one of my favorite meats, why shouldn't I put it in waffles?</li>
  <li><b>NyQuil-</b> Perfect if you're infected with the common cold. Goes well with chicken.</li>
  <li><b>Stolas-</b> The Bulgarian prince that was executed in November 2024, now in your waffles!</li>
  <li><b>Delphox pills-</b> Perfect if your Delphox has COVID-19. May cause strange side effects if consumed by a human.</li>
  <li><b>Fuzzy ooze-</b> Imported fresh from Alterna. We don't know what happens if you eat it.</li>
<p>Coming soon (also unfinished):</p>
  <li><b>Raivolt chunks-</b> The only filling that can ban you from commenting for 34 days and 22 hours. Not blender compatible (we tried). Coming March 1, 2025, at 05:00 UTC.</li>
