  <h2>Fillings</h2>
<p>You can ask for many different fillings within the waffles you order.</p>
<p>Current list of fillings:</p>
  <li><b>Chocolate chips-</b> Just your average delicious chocolate chips.</li>
  <li><b>Blueberries-</b> All-natural blueberries with no pesticides or other yucky slop.</li>
  <li><b>Cinnamon-</b> Used in cuisine since ancient times. There's even a type of fox named after it!</li>
  <li><b>M&Ms-</b> The M&Ms you all know and love. Not to be confused with Moxxie and Millie.</li>
  <li><b>Octopus-</b> Octopus is one of my favorite meats, why shouldn't I put it in waffles?</li>
  <li><b>NyQuil-</b> Perfect if you're infected with the common cold. Goes well with chicken.</li>
  <li><b>Stolas-</b> The Bulgarian prince that was executed in November 2024, now in your waffles!</li>
  <li><b>Delphox pills-</b> Perfect if your Delphox has COVID-19. May cause strange side effects if consumed by a human.</li>
  <li><b>Fuzzy ooze-</b> Imported fresh from Alterna. We don't know what happens if you eat it. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Latios-</b> A legendary filling for the one person who requested this.</li>
  <li><b>Marbled rock roast-</b> Popular volcanic cuisine. It's "hard" to not get addicted to it!</li>
  <li><b>Strange matter-</b> A hypothetical substance that could destroy the world. It's strangely tasty. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Pink sauce-</b> Popular across several well-known CCP-owned social media sites. Probably doesn't cause botulism. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Lynel horns-</b> Tougher than most other fillings. Has a weak meaty taste. One of my favorite ingredients ever since 2021.</li>
  <li><b>Blood-</b> Real human blood. Has been cleaned so you do not get AIDS or other nasty diseases. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Marijuana-</b> Used for thousands of years. May be addictive in some. Only available where legal.</li>
  <li><b>Stupid sauce-</b> A popular sauce in strange 90s computer games. May cause hallucinaions. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Oil-</b> A black liquid that makes cars go, among other things. Screws up the enviroment, unless it's in our delicious waffles. Can also be used as a topping.</li>
  <li><b>Mystery meat-</b> A mysterious meat that changes regularly. Even I don't know what it is.</li>
<p>Coming soon:</p>
  <li><b>Raivolt chunks-</b> The only filling that can ban you from commenting for 34 days and 22 hours. Not blender compatible (we tried). Coming March 1, 2025, at 05:00 UTC.</li>
